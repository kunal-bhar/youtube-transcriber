1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,654
You don't need to do a completely novel analysis or use brand new data to

2
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:06,750
differentiate your data. Science projects. Sometimes a great

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,158
story will do as much, if not more than these things to get

4
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:13,834
you noticed. Rather than just jumping straight into an analysis,

5
00:00:13,942 --> 00:00:17,638
think about who the analysis analysis is for. Working with the Titanic

6
00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:21,162
data set has completely different meaning. You're analyzing it

7
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:24,318
to understand the risk. For an insurance company looking to

8
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:28,074
cover another large ship. An analysis of the Irish dataset comes to life

9
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:31,938
if your customer is the largest flower shop in New York City who's trying

10
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:35,338
to reduce their costs by identifying pickable flowers with machine

11
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:38,250
learning. These are some of the most boring and common projects you can do,

12
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,418
but they've become exciting by envisioning the customer and the

13
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:44,826
story associated with them. If you want to stand out, add these elements to

14
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:48,438
your projects and talk about them in story form on your resume and

15
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:51,558
in your interviews. This is a short video, so do me a favor and watch

16
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:55,242
it again. While you're watching, think about who the target of your most recent project

17
00:00:55,316 --> 00:00:58,740
is and how you could tell a great story around that project.
