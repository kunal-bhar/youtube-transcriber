You don't need to do a completely novel analysis or use brand new data to differentiate your data. Science projects. Sometimes a great story will do as much, if not more than these things to get you noticed. Rather than just jumping straight into an analysis, think about who the analysis analysis is for. Working with the Titanic data set has completely different meaning. You're analyzing it to understand the risk. For an insurance company looking to cover another large ship. An analysis of the Irish dataset comes to life if your customer is the largest flower shop in New York City who's trying to reduce their costs by identifying pickable flowers with machine learning. These are some of the most boring and common projects you can do, but they've become exciting by envisioning the customer and the story associated with them. If you want to stand out, add these elements to your projects and talk about them in story form on your resume and in your interviews. This is a short video, so do me a favor and watch it again. While you're watching, think about who the target of your most recent project is and how you could tell a great story around that project.
