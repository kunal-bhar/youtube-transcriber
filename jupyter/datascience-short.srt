00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:05,190
Data science is a bit of a buzzword and a hot topic in tech

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,898
these days. As a practicing data scientist, I figured I'd explain

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:12,438
what the field is. In this short, to spice things up,

4
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:16,242
I will be explaining what the field is after after I eat one of

5
00:00:16,256 --> 00:00:17,850
these. Habaneros,

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,500
I forgot this.

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,094
Okay, the most basic level data science

8
00:00:28,202 --> 00:00:32,290
is problem solving. It's a multidisciplinary

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,926
approach to problem solving. So we borrow from the field of computer

10
00:00:35,988 --> 00:00:39,226
science, from statistics and from business.

11
00:00:39,348 --> 00:00:43,378
A typical problem would be to predict if

12
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:46,694
someone will buy your products after visiting

13
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:49,990
your website site. If you want to learn more about data science, machine learning,

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,930
artificial intelligence, check out my YouTube channel,

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,254
part of some fun project videos. I also have a lot of live

16
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:58,790
content about how to break into the field. I massively regret.
