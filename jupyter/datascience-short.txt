Data science is a bit of a buzzword and a hot topic in tech these days. As a practicing data scientist, I figured I'd explain what the field is. In this short, to spice things up, I will be explaining what the field is after after I eat one of these. Habaneros, I forgot this. Okay, the most basic level data science is problem solving. It's a multidisciplinary approach to problem solving. So we borrow from the field of computer science, from statistics and from business. A typical problem would be to predict if someone will buy your products after visiting your website site. If you want to learn more about data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, check out my YouTube channel, part of some fun project videos. I also have a lot of live content about how to break into the field. I massively regret.
